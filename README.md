Quick introduction to TPOT using MNIST database

Automated ML is a growing trend, either we like it or hate it. From the dozens of available tools, I have chosen to test TPOT, a Python library from Automated ML. 

In another repo I would like to test AutoKeras, because TPOT does not integrate neural networks. 

Software: 
+ Python 3.7
+ TPOT 0.10.1
+ usual python libraries: numpy, pandas, etc.
